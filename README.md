OLD UNMAINTAINED REPO, CHECK http://9v.lt FOR UPDATES

EvilLogBot logs channel messages in raw format to an SQLite or MySQL database (could be extended to other DB's through modules) and pulls out a specified amount of days worth of logs to be used. This bot was primarily developed to be used with an EvilZone network, so it may not work with other networks.
Bot configs are in the main script. DB configs are in each module for each DB type.
